        Rightech IoT Cloud is a tool for developers. RIC is independent of specific equipment and protocols, which makes it easier for developers to combine different devices under one solution.Platform tools allow developers to create IoT solutions without extra code and reuse 90% of that solution to launch similar cases.
        
        We can download the stored data from Rightech IoT in different formats and those are
 GPX, or GPS Exchange Format, is an XML schema designed as a common GPS data format for software applications.
 CSV (comma-separated values) file is a text file that has a specific format that allows data to be saved in a table-structured format.
 JSON (JavaScript Object Notation, pronounced /ˈdʒeɪsən/; also /ˈdʒeɪ
ˌsɒn/) is an open standard file format and data interchange format
that uses human-readable text to store and transmit data objects consisting of attribute–value pairs and arrays (or other serializable values).
I have downloaded it in JSON format which is given below.



The JSON object you provided contains information about a humidity and temperature reading. The object has the following properties:
 _org: The organization ID.  _mid: The message ID.
  _oid: The object ID.
  humidity: The humidity reading.
  _ts: The timestamp of the reading.
 id: The ID of the device that sent the reading.  _lic: The license ID.
 online: Whether the device is online.  time: The time of the reading.
 _bot: Whether the device is a bot.
 payload: The payload of the message.  _gid: The group ID.
  topic: The topic of the message.
  temperature: The temperature reading.  _id: The ID of the JSON object.
The topic property indicates that the message was published to the base/state/humidity topic. The payload property contains the value of the humidity reading, which is 63.93. The temperature property contains the value of the temperature reading, which is 27.77.
