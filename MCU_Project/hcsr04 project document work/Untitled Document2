1.project summary

The Internet of Things (IoT) is a rapidly growing field that has the potential to revolutionize the way we interact with the world around us. One of the most promising applications of IoT is in the area of distance measuring between the object. By deploying IoT devices in various measuring, we can collect real-time data by measuring distance. This data can then be used to track distance between the object over time, identify potential problems, and take corrective action.

This project proposes the development of an IoT-based distance monitoring system using STM32, HC-SR04, and W10 WiFi modules. The system will use an STM32 microcontroller to acquire sensor data from an HC-SR04 distance sensor. The sensor data will then be published to MQTT using the W10 WiFi module, where it can be accessed by a web application or other IoT devices. The web application will allow users to visualize the sensor data and track changes in environmental conditions over time.
The system will be deployed in a real-world environment to test its performance. The deployment results will be used to assess the system's feasibility and identify any potential improvements.

The proposed system has the potential to be a valuable tool for tracking and monitoring distance between the objects. The system is relatively low-cost and easy to deploy, making it a feasible option for a wide range of applications. The system is also scalable, making it possible to deploy it in a variety of environments.

The results of this project will contribute to the body of knowledge on IoT- based distance measuring systems. The project will also provide a valuable case study for other researchers and developers who are interested in developing IoT-based ecological distance measuring  systems.

 4.Why interrupt based uart communication

The advantages of interrupt-based UART communication over other methods:
 Improved efficiency: The CPU is not constantly polling the UART status, so it can be used for other tasks. This can improve the efficiency of the system and reduce power consumption.
 Reduced latency: Interrupt-based communication can be faster than polling, as the CPU is only interrupted when data is ready to be sent or received. This can improve the responsiveness of the system.
 Better multitasking: Interrupt-based communication allows the CPU to handle multiple UART events simultaneously. This can be useful for applications that require frequent and asynchronous serial communication.
Here are some of the disadvantages of interrupt-based UART communication:
 More complex code: Interrupt-based communication is more complex to implement than polling. This is because the programmer needs to write code to handle the interrupts.
 More overhead: Interrupt-based communication can have more overhead than polling. This is because the CPU needs to save and restore its state when it is interrupted.
Overall, interrupt-based UART communication is a more efficient and responsive way to communicate with serial devices. However, it is more complex to implement and can have more overhead.

Here are some examples of applications where interrupt-based UART communication would be a good choice:
 Sensor networks: Sensor networks often need to communicate with each other or with a central server. Interrupt-based communication can be used to improve the efficiency and responsiveness of these networks.
 Wireless modules: Wireless modules often use UART to communicate with the host microcontroller. Interrupt-based communication can be used to improve the performance of these modules.
 Real-time systems: Real-time systems often need to communicate with other devices in a timely manner. Interrupt-based communication can be used to ensure that these communications are not missed.

Buffer Declaration: It declares a character array buffer with a size of 50.

String Formatting: The sprintf function is used to format a string and store it in the buffer. The formatted string includes a command "CMD+MQTTPUB" followed by a topic "base/state/distance" and a floating-point number with two decimal places (%.2f). The floating-point number seems to be the value of a variable dis1.

UART Transmission: The HAL_UART_Transmit function is then called twice to send the formatted string over UART (Universal Asynchronous Receiver-Transmitter). It is transmitted to two different UART peripherals (huart1 and huart2). The third argument specifies the length of the data to be transmitted, and the fourth argument is the timeout duration in milliseconds.

Delay: Finally, there's a delay of 100 milliseconds using HAL_Delay.

In summary, this code is likely part of a larger program for an embedded system. It sends a formatted MQTT-like message containing a distance value over two UART channels with a delay afterward. The specific UART peripherals used (huart1 and huart2) and the value of the distance (dis1) are likely defined elsewhere in the code.



Time-Triggered Measurement: The code checks whether a specific time interval (1 second in this case) has passed since the last measurement. This is done by comparing the current system tick (HAL_GetTick()) with the time of the last measurement (last_measurement_time).

Ultrasonic Sensor Measurement: If the specified time interval has elapsed, it performs an ultrasonic distance measurement using a timer (htim8) and captures the value from Channel 1 (TIM_CHANNEL_1). The captured value is stored in the variable echo1.

Distance Calculation: The echo1 value is then converted to distance (dis1) using the formula dis1 = echo1 / 58.0f, assuming it's an ultrasonic sensor measuring distance in centimeters.

Print to Console: The measured values (echo1 and dis1) are printed to the console using the printf function.

UART Transmission: The measured values are formatted into a string and transmitted over UART to two different peripherals (huart2 and huart1) using HAL_UART_Transmit. The transmitted string includes the distance value (dis1) and the echo value (echo1).

Delay: There's a delay of 1000 milliseconds (HAL_Delay(1000)) after the measurements and UART transmissions. This delay controls the frequency of the measurements, and you can adjust it based on your application's requirements.

In summary, this code performs periodic ultrasonic distance measurements, prints the results to the console, and transmits the data over UART to two different peripherals. The time interval between measurements is controlled by the specified delay of 1000 milliseconds.

The MQTT_Init() function is a simple example of how to initialize a WE10 module and connect it to an MQTT broker. The function takes no arguments and it returns void.
Here is a more detailed explanation of the code:
 The CMD+MQTTNETCFG command is used to configure the MQTT parameters of the WE10 module. The first parameter is the hostname or IP address of the MQTT broker. The second parameter is the port number of the MQTT broker.
 The CMD+MQTTCONCFG command is used to configure the MQTT client of the WE10 module. The first parameter is the username of the MQTT client. The second parameter is the password of the MQTT client.

The message includes a command ("CMD+MQTTPUB"), a topic ("base/state/distance"), and a floating-point value (dis1) with two decimal places.
The formatted message stored in the buffer is transmitted via UART. The HAL_UART_Transmit function is used for this purpose. The message is sent to two UART interfaces (huart1 and huart2), and the third argument specifies the timeout duration (1000 milliseconds in this case).
A delay of 100 milliseconds is introduced using HAL_Delay. This delay allows time for the UART transmissions to complete before the function exits.In summary, this code snippet is part of a larger program, and its purpose is to format and transmit an MQTT message containing distance information (dis1) over two UART interfaces (huart1 and huart2). The delay at the end ensures that there is sufficient time for the transmissions to complete before moving on.




The code you provided is a initialize a WE10 module and connect it to an MQTT broker. The code first declares a buffer of 128 characters. The buffer will be used to store the commands that are sent to the WE10 module.
The next few lines of code send the CMD+MQTTNETCFG command to the WE10 module. This command configures the module to connect to the MQTT broker at dev.rightech.io on port 1883. The CMD+MQTTCONCFG command configures the module to connect to the MQTT broker as a client with the username mqtt-arifm4348- ud8eo8 and no password. The CMD+MQTTSTART command starts the MQTT client and connects to the broker. The CMD+MQTTSUB command subscribes the client to the topic base/relay/led1.

The MQTT_Init() function is a simple example of how to initialize a WE10 module and connect it to an MQTT broker. The function takes no arguments and it returns void.
Here is a more detailed explanation of the code:
 The CMD+MQTTNETCFG command is used to configure the MQTT parameters of the WE10 module. The first parameter is the hostname or IP address of the MQTT broker. The second parameter is the port number of the MQTT broker.
 The CMD+MQTTCONCFG command is used to configure the MQTT client of the WE10 module. The first parameter is the username of the MQTT client. The second parameter is the password of the MQTT client.
 The CMD+MQTTSTART command is used to start the MQTT client of the WE10 module. This command connects the client to the MQTT broker.
  The CMD+MQTTSUB command is used to subscribe the MQTT client to a topic. The first parameter is the topic that the client wants to subscribe to.
